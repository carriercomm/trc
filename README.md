## TRC ##

TRC is the ultimate revision control system

trc advantages:

* simple: no options, just one argument
* decentralized: doesn't even have cumbersome network capacities
* lightweight: easy to install, doesn't rely on 42 obscure libraries, or perl
* standard: you can use it even if you don't have it
* collaborative: just use it with netcat, scp, rsync, mail, ftp...
* clear: revision is just a date, not an obscure hash or number
* naturally compress: your code is naturally compressed by trc, less disk space wasted
* pragmatic: who has time to set up a git repository?

## How to use it? ##

It's really simple:

```
me@my-host # trc <project directory> 
```
